# SFML-CPP
This program will display the funny message for May 20th in a window.

In order for this program to run, we need to put "bin", "include", "lib" inside a file call "sfml". and put all other files inside the source file. "Funny 520 Message. txt" is the source code.

Just in Case if the program still not running. we need to set up the visual studio to load SFML. 

you can watch this video about how to set it up: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axIgxBQVBg0
